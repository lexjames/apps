<p><strong>B'Gorgeous</strong> can supply the latest range of hair care products that are ideal for maintaining your unique style and in turn, keep the finish until your next in-home salon visit. Delivered to your door, the product range includes Tigi Styling Products and Corioliss Styling Tools .</p>

<p>The products are available at competitive prices with savings over high street prices.</p>

<p>Tara has 23 years experience in the hairdressing industry, with the focus on providing an in-home professional salon experience to clients throughout Oxted and surrounding areas.</p>

<p>A gap in the 'Home Hairdressing' market was idenitfied when I heard from various Clients that felt going to the Salon wasn't as relaxing as it should be; I felt the same; sometimes a bit too 'busy' and not always relaxing. After all, we all like to escape and have a little 'me time'. We should all be pampered, whether at home or in a Salon. So I provide everything you expect to get from a good high street Salon; Up to date magazines, Tea and coffee selections, those naughty Caf'e biscuits and ever so lovely chocolates!</p>

<p>After your Salon experience, I clear all area's I have worked in and take all debris away with me; well you wouldn't wash your own hair or sweep up in the salon, would you? This leaves you all the time you want to B'Gorgeous! Full liability insurance is provided along with State Registration, which is a voluntary membership. This is to ensure you receive a fully qualified, professional, peace of mind service.</p>
